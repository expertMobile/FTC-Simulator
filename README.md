# FTC Simulator
Contains 3 tools to assist in FTC programming
 - Autonomous Planner Tool
	 - Uses global coordinate system for coordinates (in inches), angles (in radians) 
	 - Click or drag the robot or enter position + angle  
 - Match Replayer Tool  
	 - Reads values from a robot data CSV file to replay robot runs on your screen
	 - Shows position, colored coded path, velocity, acceleration, robot states, and more
 - Robot Simulator Tool
	 - Simulates an FTC Robot on a field
	 - Given the starting x and y coordinates, angle, velocity, and angular velocity, the robot's movement can be simulated in real time
